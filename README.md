# Mateofy

Mateofy is a web app that allows you to play songs from a defined playlist (for my son) with a simple interface and some limitations to avoid overuse by the child.
It uses the Spotify API to read the tracks, the playlist and play the songs.
It is also a personal project to learn React.

## Features

- [ ] Play songs from a playlist
- [ ] Pause/Play
- [ ] Next song
- [ ] Previous song
- [ ] Repeat
- [ ] Limit the number of songs played per day


## Template used

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
